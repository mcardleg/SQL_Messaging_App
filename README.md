# messaging_app_database
SQL scripts to implement a MYSQL database for a generic messaging app.


#CSU 44D01 Project Specification

Deadline: 12 noon, 26th Nov. 2021

The CSU 44D01 project is to develop an ER Model for information to be represented for an
application of your OWN choice and implement it as a MySQL database. The project
submission will be a report which describes the database application, presents the ER
Model of the database, indicate how this ER model is mapped to a relational schema, give
the Functional Dependency Model for each of the relations in the database indicating
primary & foreign keys, explain and give the SQL code needed to implement the database
and shows how it would be used. The project will create the database as a MySQL database.

The database must have the following features:

• A minimum of 6 relational tables

• Appropriate implicit and constraints (including primary & foreign keys)

• Explicit (semantic) constraints such as table constraint(s) and triggers (you need not
implement assertions)

• At least one view should also be defined within the database

• A minimum of 5 tuples per table

• Your Project report must have a listing of the SQL commands which create the
tables, populate these tables,

• Additional marks will be awarded for innovation and degree of difficulty (in use of
SQL) and the use of advanced features of SQL/PL e.g. use of variables in SQL/PL,
embedded programmes etc.

• You are required to implement the database using MySQL, which is available on
college lab computers or downloadable on your own machines.
Project will be submitted as a report (see example table of contents below) as a PDF file.
